# Ethereum Transaction Optimizer

An AI-powered tool to predict Ethereum network congestion and recommend optimal transaction timing and parameters.

## üöÄ Overview

This hackathon project demonstrates how AI can be used to optimize Ethereum transactions by:

- Monitoring real-time gas prices and network congestion
- Predicting future congestion patterns using AI models
- Recommending optimal transaction times and gas prices
- Analyzing historical gas data to identify patterns

## ‚ú® Features

- **Current Network Status**: Real-time gas prices and network congestion levels
- **AI-Powered Transaction Optimization**: Get personalized recommendations for transaction timing and gas prices
- **Congestion Forecast**: Visualize predicted network congestion for the next 24 hours
- **Real-time Gas Price Chart**: Live Etherscan API integration with auto-refresh capabilities
- **Historical Gas Analysis**: Track gas price trends with AI-generated insights

## üîß Technical Implementation

This project can connect to real Ethereum network data or simulate predictions using synthetic data. For full functionality with real-time Ethereum data, it integrates with:

- Ethereum blockchain via Infura API
- Gas price data via Etherscan API
- Pattern detection algorithms for price prediction
- Time-based congestion forecast models

## üìã Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts for interactive charts
- **Ethereum Interaction**: ethers.js for blockchain connectivity
- **State Management**: React Query for data fetching and caching

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ethereum-transaction-optimizer.git
cd ethereum-transaction-optimizer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up your API keys:
   - Sign up for an Infura account at https://infura.io/ and create a new project to get an API key
   - Sign up for an Etherscan account at https://etherscan.io/apis and create a new API key

4. Create a `.env.local` file and add your API keys:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_key
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Real-time Gas Price Chart

The Gas Price History component features real-time data integration with Etherscan:

- **Live API Connection**: Fetches current gas prices directly from Etherscan
- **Auto-refresh Capability**: Configurable refresh intervals (10s, 30s, 1m, 5m)
- **Manual Refresh**: Force refresh data at any time with a single click
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicators for API connection status
- **API Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to synthetic data if API limits are reached

To use this feature, ensure you have added your Etherscan API key to the `.env.local` file:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_key
```

The free Etherscan API has rate limits (currently 5 calls per second, up to 100,000 calls per day). The application respects these limits through reasonable refresh intervals and fallback mechanisms.

### Note on API Usage

- Without API keys, the app will fall back to synthetic data to demonstrate functionality
- With valid Infura API key, you'll get real-time Ethereum network data
- With valid Etherscan API key, you'll get real current gas price data (historical data is synthesized based on current values)

## üìà Future Enhancements

For a production version, we would implement:

- **Real AI/ML Backend**: Train models on historical Ethereum data
- **Historical Data Storage**: Store gas price data over time for better predictions
- **User Accounts**: Save preferences and transaction history
- **Transaction Execution**: Allow users to directly execute transactions at optimal times
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Extend to other EVM-compatible blockchains
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile experience with push notifications for optimal transaction windows
